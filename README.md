# ðŸ§­ Polarsteps API Client

`polarsteps-api` is a light Python wrapper built on top of REST APIs discovered on https://www.polarsteps.com! The goal of this package is to allow open-source, fan-based development of Polarsteps features. In their own words:

> At Polarsteps, everyone is an explorer at heart. So itâ€™s only fitting that our app wasnâ€™t born at a desk, but on a catamaran, halfway across the Atlantic. No business plan, no boardroom â€” just Niek, a Dutch adventurer with a vision, a bit of technical know-how, and nothing but open water as far as the eye could see.
>
> The idea was simple: capture the adventure and let others follow along. Armed with a basic satellite setup, Niek created a way to ping his location and his descriptions of the day to a server back home, mapping his journey in real time so friends and family could come for the ride.
The more he traveled, the more he tracked. The more he tracked, the more people followed.
>
> But some did more than follow â€” they saw potential. What if this wasnâ€™t just for one trip? What if it was for all travelers?

ðŸ§­ Go forth and build!

## Available APIs
1. `get_user_by_username` - Fetch complete user profile including trips, statistics, followers, and followees
2. `get_trip` - Get detailed information for individual trips by ID
3. _more as/if they come!_

## Installation
```bash
uv sync --dev && uv pip install -e .
uv run main.py
```

## Remember Tokens
The API client relies on an authenticated token, for which you must be an active Polarsteps customer. To obtain this:
1. Log in to [Polarsteps](https://www.polarsteps.com/) in your browser
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to Application/Storage tab â†’ Cookies
4. Find the `remember_token` cookie value
5. Copy this value to use with the client
  - _e.g.: `export POLARSTEPS_REMEMBER_TOKEN=<your-token-here>`_

## Quick Start
```python
from polarsteps_api.client import PolarstepsClient
from polarsteps_api.models.response import TripResponse, UserResponse
from polarsteps_api.models.trip import Trip
from polarsteps_api.models.user import User

# Initialize the client
client = PolarstepsClient(remember_token = YOUR_TOKEN)

# Example User data
get_user_response: UserResponse = client.get_user_by_username(args.username)
user_data: User | None = get_user_response.user
if get_user_response.is_error or user_data is None:
    exit()
print(
    f"@{args.username} - {user_data.first_name} {user_data.last_name} [{user_data.country_count} countries / {int(user_data.stats.km_count):,}km]"
)

# Example Trip data
trip_id = (
    # Choose a random trip to get information about
    str(random.choice(user_data.alltrips).id)
    if len(user_data.alltrips or []) > 0 and user_data.alltrips is not None
    else args.trip_id
)
get_trip_response: TripResponse = client.get_trip(trip_id)
trip: Trip | None = get_trip_response.trip
if get_trip_response.is_error or trip is None:
    exit()
print(f"Random Trip - {(trip.name or 'Unknown').strip()} {int(trip.total_km):,}km")  # type: ignore
```
